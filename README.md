# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Study Guide Project was made to help explain and give an intro to web development. It covers a few starting topics such as HTML, CSS, JacaScript, and Git, giving notes on each of the topics. The purpose of the project is to get you started on the journey of understanding web development. By putting all the info into each of their own sections and explaining them one at a time it makes it so that you get bite size info without overwhemling you. In the project guide that was given it provided many links that helped explain a lot of the concepts that were shown, and showed us how to use devtools so we can further interact with our page which makes us better programmers.
